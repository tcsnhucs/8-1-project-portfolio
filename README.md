# 8-1-project-portfolio

This was a project to built a clock that showed off both 12 hour am/pm time, as well as 24 hour time as 2 displays, that could also be manually changed by the user. This was the first project I worked on, and it was before I started using header files for my classes, something that, if I were to make the clock today, I would have done. Besides that, I feel I did a great job with this clock and am especially happy that the clock starts out set to the user's current time, as, while that wasn't required by the project specifications, it made sense to me to have that work as a starting point. That part was also the most difficult part to write as I had to learn documentation of the ctime library in order to program it's functionality. Primarily what would make this program maintainable, readable and adaptable would be my extensive use of comments to ensure that every line is easy to understand if were unfamiliar with the code behind it.
